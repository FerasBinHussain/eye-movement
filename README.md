# Eye-Movement

In this exercise, I used some of my skills in manipulating styles. In addition, I was exploring what is possible when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together!

I've created a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to install http-server.

```bash
npm install http-server
```

## How to run

```bash
# after cloning the repo navigate to project directory
cd PATH/Eye-Movement

# load http-server 
http-server  # on Windows (http-server.cmd)

# http-server will return the available localhost ports that running the local server
# Available on:
#  http://127.0.0.1:8080 <-- in my case

# open the available URL in your browser 
```
